# Distributed Training using TensorFlow

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to using TensorFlow for distributed training. The notebook demonstrates different parallelizing strategies, custom training loops, and implementation of strategies with Keras for distributed model training.

## Repository Contents

- `Distributed_Training_using_TensorFlow.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that covers the basics of distributed training using TensorFlow, including setup, usage, and examples.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Understand different types of parallelizing strategies
- Use a custom training loop
- Implement a few strategies with Keras
- Train the model by making use of distributed training

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Necessary Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt` file)
- TensorFlow

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Distributed_Training_using_TensorFlow.git
    cd Distributed_Training_using_TensorFlow
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. Open the notebook `Distributed_Training_using_TensorFlow.ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to learn about and use TensorFlow for distributed training.

## Notes
